# PNG to ASCII

Simple CLI tool to get ASCII from a PNG file.

## Usage

```
npm run build
npm start <filename> [ascii width]
```

ASCII width defaults to 50.

## Notes

The result is better if the background in just white. Transparent is generally considered black so it won't render very well.

Images with a lot of details may need to be wider.
